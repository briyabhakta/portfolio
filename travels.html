      <p>Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to study abroad in Madrid, Spain for six weeks.
        I lived with a host family while taking two Spanish courses.
        One course was on Spanish literature, and the other one was one Madridâ€™s history.
        I had a great time and met so many amazing new friends.
        We did some travelling during the program to Valencia and Sevilla.</p>

      <p>After the program, my friend and I travelled up through Europe.
        We started in Barcelona, then travelled to Rome, Florence, Switzerland, Paris, London, and Scotland.
        I had so much fun, and did and saw so many new things.
        I loved going to all the museums and trying all different types of food.</p>
