              <p>I studied in Madrid for six weeks in May and June. I took two classes: one
                 on old Spanish Literature, and one on the history of Madrid the city. I took
                 this picture of Gran Vía, Madrid's most popular downtown street, from a rooftop bar.

                Around this area are many stores and bakeries. I especialyl liked the
                the local stores, as I was able to try so many new things.</p>

              <p>London was amazing, and my favorite city I traveled to (outside
                 Madrid, of course!) Here, I am outside of Buckingham Palace, where
                 Queen Elizabeth lives. Sadly, she wasn't there when I visited, but
                 I still had a great time; it was beautiful.</p>

              <p>Although I didn't go inside the Coliseum, it was still amazing from
                the outside. Not only did I see beautiful things in Rome, but I also
                ate amazing things. I had the tiramisu in Rome. It was so interesting
                to see how all the old architecture built so long ago still remained
                intact with minimal reconstruction.</p>

              <h1 class="location">Edinburgh, Scotland</h1>
              <p>Scotland was amazing. The architecture was so different compared
                 to all the places I went to. This picture is a street in Edinburgh
                looking onto Edinburgh Castle up on top of the hill. Although the
                weather was a bit rainy, I believe that it fit well with the nature
                of the city, and I would really love to go back there again.</p>

              <p>Everything about Paris was just like I imagined. It was super hot,
                 and we only had one day there, but I still had the best time. The Eiffel
                 Tower was so much larger when I saw it in real life, and it looked
                 truly amazing. In addition to the tower, I saw the pyramids at the
                 Louvre, the Notre Dame, the Arc de Triomfe, and the Seine River.</p>

              <h1 class="location">Sevilla, Spain</h1>
              <p>Sevilla was the most beautiful city I have ever seen. The architecture
                 was breathtaking. It was a combination of Christian and Moorish styles
                 and it was extraordinary. This is a picture of the Plaza de España; it
                 was incredibly large, and I could've spent hours there admiring its
                 beauty.</p>

              <h1 class="location">Barcelona, Spain</h1>
              <p>Although we only had one day here, Barcelona was amazing and we saw so much.
                 We mainly saw structures designed by Antoni Gaudí, and I was truly
                 amazed by his architecture. This is the Sagrada Familia, a famous
                 Basílica designed by Gaudí. Although unfinished, it is the most
                 amazing Basílica I've ever seen. I loved the elements of nature and
                 the modernity of the building; it was so unique, and nothing like
                 I've ever seen before.</p>

              <p>Switzerland was so beautiful. The nature had me speechless, and it
                 was a nice change of pace from the bustling tourist cities we
                 had traveled to in Europe. The town we went to was fairly secluded,
                 and it was just a small village. It was nice and quiet, and as seen
                 in this photo, there were so many beautiful waterfalls and a nice,
                 flowing stream.</p>
