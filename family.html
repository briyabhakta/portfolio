      <p>I was born on September 21, 1999 in Troy, Michigan.
        In 2001, my family moved to Canton, Michigan.
        Canton is a township approximately twenty minutes away from Ann Arbor.
        I lived there from 2001 until 2017, when I began living in Ann Arbor for college.
        I went to Canton Charter Academy for grades Kindergarten through 8th grade,
        and I went to Plymouth High School for four years, graduating In 2017.
        I currently attend the University of Michigan, and am
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information and a Spanish minor.</p>

      <p>I have one sibling; a 21-year old brother who studies Genetics at Michigan State University.
        He plans to go to grad school for Biotechnology next year.
        My dad is a physician, and my mom is an HR Generalist at the University of Michigan.
        My parents still live in Canton. My Dad grew up in Troy, Michigan,
        and my mom grew up in California. As family, we love to travel.
        Our best trip by far was summer 2017, when we travelled to Greece for two weeks.
        I love spending time with my family, and am glad I live close by them during college.</p>
