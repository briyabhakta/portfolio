      <p>I love listening to music. My favorite band is Coldplay.
        I saw them in concert when I was in high school, and I had a great time.
        Some of my other favorite artists are Wallows, Ed Sheeran, and Brockhampton.
        My music taste varies, and has evolved immensely over the years.
        I listen to many different genres; what I listen to each day usually reflects my mood.
        I have been to many concerts, including OneRepublic, Big Sean,
        Coldplay, Wallows, Ed Sheeran, and Shawn Mendes.
        I had a great time at all these concerts- Coldplay and Wallows were my favorite ones.
        Another one of my favorite albums is the Hamilton soundtrack.
        I saw the musical in Chicago in October 2018, and I loved it.<p>

      <p>I also love to bake. Especially when I am back home in Canton,
        I bake all the time- cakes, cookies, and pies. I recently baked a cheesecake that was amazing.
        My dad loves coconut, so I usually make him coconut cream pie on his birthdays.
        In my free time, I like to bake, do puzzles, and hang out with friends.</p>
